A small toy project to scan a large list of available Tickers from Yahoo Finance for criteria described by Mark Spitznagel in "The Dao of Capital". Spitznagel highlights two criteria investors should look for,
a low "Faustmann" Ratio and high Return on invested Capital.
He recommends the following formulas which are roughly used in the scripts:
Faustmann Ratio - Market Capitalization (of common equity) / Net Worth (invested capital + cash - debt - preferred equity) and ROIC - EBIT/Invested Capital
